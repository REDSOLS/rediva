            <ul>Customers can return their order within 5 days after an order has been delivered.
                <li>In the interests of hygiene, we may refuse returns where it's obvious that the item has been worn, washed or soiled. Defective products need not be sent back to us, unless confirmed by the Customer Experience Team. If you have received a defective product, send us images at redlifestyl@gmail.com and we will get back to you. Once confirmed by the Customer Experience Team the refund will be provided either into your bank account or as Rediva Money as per your convenience.</li>
                <li>If you have to return anything from a combo pack, the whole pack will have to be returned. There will not be any partial returns accepted for this. If there is a manufacturing issue, or if you have any other query regarding this, you can contact us on the number or email us on redlifestyl@gmail.com.
                    Gift cards/vouchers are non-refundable.</li>
                <li>To maintain strict hygiene standards of our products, we do not accept returns on several product categories, including but not limited to masks, boxers, shorts, sweat-activated t-shirts and socks. The Rediva Store may, at its discretion and without prior notice, change the products or categories to which this policy would apply.</li>
